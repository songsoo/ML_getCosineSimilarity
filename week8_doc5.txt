The anti-vaccination movement has gained traction online in recent years, and campaigners opposed to vaccination have moved their focus to making claims relating to the coronavirus. First, a video containing inaccurate claims about coronavirus vaccine trials, made by osteopath Carrie Madej, that has proved popular on social media. Carrie Madej's video makes a false claim that the vaccines will change recipients' DNA (which carries genetic information).
"The Covid-19 vaccines are designed to make us into genetically modified organisms." She also claims—without any evidence—that vaccines will "hook us all up to an artificial intelligence interface".
